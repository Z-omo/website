# Welcome

I am Colin Tester, I work with organisations to help build better web experiences. I am fortunate to maintain a reputation for producing well-crafted, consistent and user friendly solutions for mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

<blockquote><q>I was looking for high quality, value-for-money and flexible supportâ€¦Colin has provided an excellent service in all areas, and often exceeded my expectations.</q><p class="by-line">Gail Allan, Busines Development Director, Family Links</p></blockquote>

The desirable outcomes of a project, of any size, will always evolve over time. By promoting continuous customer collaboration and paying close attention to a project solution's design and technical quality, I aim to deliver durable and valuable results.
