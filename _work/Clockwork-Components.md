Clockwork Components are one of the largest suppliers of components to furniture makers; both large and small. Their extensive range of established and new products required a system to manage and deliver crucial information to their customers in a fast and efficient manner.

Working with designer Steve Foote of Tin Racer Design, we considered carefully how to optimise product data for delivery to handheld and desktop devices.

Clockwork Components know their customer well and understood how their customers like to source components. Steve and I, therefore, took this important information on board, which led to the design of a mechanism that would not overwhelm customers with vast amounts of preliminary data; either through an initial download, or how the product data is presented. Instead, users can choose to focus easily into specific component types and are rewarded with results quickly.
