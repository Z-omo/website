## Website and Products Manager

Clockwork Components is the UK's leading supplier of components to furniture makers, large and small. Clockwork Components's extensive range of established and new products required a system to manage and deliver crucial information to their customers in a fast and efficient manner.

Working with designer Steve Foote of [Tin Racer Design](https://www.tinracer.com/), we considered carefully how to optimise product data for fast delivery to handheld and desktop devices.

Clockwork Components know their customer base very well and understood how their customers prefer to source components. Steve and I, therefore, took this important information on board, and led to the design of a delivery mechanism that would not overwhelm customers with vast amounts of preliminary data; either through an initial download, or how the product data is presented. Instead, users can choose easily to focus on specific component types and are rewarded with pertinent results quickly.
