## Website and Products Manager

Clockwork Components is the UK's leading supplier of components to furniture makers, large and small. Clockwork Components's extensive range of established and new products required a system to manage and deliver crucial information to their customers in a fast and efficient manner.

Working with designer Steve Foote of [Tin Racer Design](https://www.tinracer.com/), we considered carefully how to optimise product data for fast delivery to handheld and desktop devices.

<div class="image-group">

</div>

Clockwork Components know their customer base very well and understood how their customers prefer to source components. That understanding, led Steve and I, to design an interface and delivery mechanism that would not overwhelm customers with vast amounts of preliminary data; either through an initial download, or how the product data is presented in browser. Instead, users can choose easily to focus on specific component types and are rewarded with pertinent results quickly. Returned results are cached by the client-side app, thus avoiding the need to reload data from the server during the user’s browsing session.

Crucial to the user experience, was the desire for customers to be able to zoom into a product image and see finer details. Steve and I developed a strategy for preparing and optimising product images for use on small, medium and large screen dimensions, and present *real* image enlargements when the user chooses to zoom – we did not want to disappoint users.
