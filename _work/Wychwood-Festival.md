## Website and Festival Line Up Manager

Considered to be one of the best family friendly festivals in the UK: with its laid back atmosphere, wide range of music, comedy, literature and workshops over 3 days, and set beneath the idyllic Prestbury Hills.

It has been my absolute pleasure to be involved with helping to shape the festival's brand and develop a website with the clear aim of producing a user experience which is simple and enlightening.

I also developed an app called _Backstage_ to assist with the management and presentation of the the festival's 100+ performer and activities entries.
