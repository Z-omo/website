## Website and Festival Line Up Manager

A flagship event from [Tribe Festivals Ltd](http://www.tribefestivals.com/ "To: the website of Tribe – the event producers.") and Mark and Penny Makin of [Makin Projects](http://www.makinprojects.co.uk/ "To: the website of Makin Projects, working with outstanding theatre, dance and comedy."), the Cheltenham Comedy Festival presents an enviable line up of top comedians and up and coming stars.

I took the festival's core visual elements, developing them into a multi-device experience, focusing on providing content to the end user in a fast and elegant way. The views were enhanced with CSS animation and supported by a back-end app, which I developed to manage and control the presentation of performer and event content.
