Family Links is a national charity dedicated to creating an emotionally healthy, resilient and responsible society. Producing a wealth of valuable resources and a need to allow their content to be accessibile from any device with ease of use foremost in desired outcomes. Family Links invited me to join their web team to help implement a content strategy and visual redesign, which would present users with a much improved experience.

Following best practises of Responsive Web Design (RWD), careful consideration was made to how content resources should be prepared and managed. A pattern library was developed to document the repeatable and consistent methods used to present various kinds of content. The library became an invaluable resource for maintaining content accessibility; driven by compliance with web standards and the reliable display throughout the website.

A dedicated website API (Application Programming Interface) was developed to implement dynamic content such as the integration of Twitter content; the safe delivery of ‘downloable’ resources and the caching of persistent content for browser faster load times.

<blockquote><q>As Business Development Director of a national charity, I was looking for high quality, value-for-money and flexible support with the design, implementation and on-going development of the organisation’s websites. Colin Tester has provided an excellent service in all areas, and often exceeded my expectations. Colin, provides a very high level of service and takes a genuine interest in the task of supporting the promotion of our work. He spends time understanding and discussing our requirements and is extremely flexible in his approach. All the work has been delivered on time and to budget and is off a very high quality. I would recommend Colin Tester very highly.</q><p class="by-line">Gail Allan, Busines Development Director, Family Links</p></blockquote>
