## Website, API, Online Shop and Pattern Library

Family Links is a national charity dedicated to creating an emotionally healthy, resilient and responsible society. Producing a wealth of valuable resources and a need to allow their content to be accessibile from any device with ease of use foremost in desired outcomes. Family Links invited me to join their web team to help implement a content strategy and visual redesign, which would present users with a much improved experience.

Following best practises of Responsive Web Design (RWD), careful consideration was made to how content resources should be prepared and managed. A pattern library was developed to document the repeatable and consistent methods used to present various kinds of content. The library became an invaluable resource for maintaining content accessibility; driven by compliance with web standards and the reliable display throughout the website.

A dedicated website API (Application Programming Interface) was developed to provide services for :

- loading dynamic content such as the integration of Twitter feeds
- interfacing with the Family Links CMS (content Management System)
- delivering, safely, ‘downloable’ resources such as PDFs and other file formats
- control and caching of persistent content, resulting in faster server responses
- supporting the Family Links online shop
