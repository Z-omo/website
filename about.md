I have been building web-based software since 2002 and my work is informed by the mantra: keep it simple, but elegant.

I continue to be inspired by prescribed engineering best practices and my aim always is to produce software which is clean, modular, extensible and stable. I care about the finer details.

Technology and the numerous ways that information is being communicated is changing constantly, which means it's important to keep abreast of developments in good practices, accessibility and security. I find that 50% of my working life is spent on research and training, something I beleive is true for most practitioners in the web and software industry, but the work I put into improving my knowledge helps inform the benefits I aim to provide to my clients.
